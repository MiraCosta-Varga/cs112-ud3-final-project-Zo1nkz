# Unit Deliverable 3 - Final Project GUI

Java High School Tracker

Back in my Senior year of high school, the Computer Science Club was holding a competition for who could make the best, most practical application
that our school could use. My original idea tried implementing our broadcasting channel where people could interact with it, but that quickly fell through, 
so I instead tried making a simple student tracker that would be accessible and useful for both faculty and students. It was super linear and was one screen,
so I know I could have done more with it, which is why I chose to make it my final project for this class as it would help me reinforce previous knowledge 
whilst applying new concepts that I have learned. This application takes straightforward inputs and tracks the essentials such as grades for students and 
the courses teachers teach.
